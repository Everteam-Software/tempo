Install TEMPO on tomcat 5.5 with mysql

======================================
 Introduction
======================================

Intalio Tempo is a set of runtime components that support human workflow within
an service-oriented architecture (SOA). Our main goal is to provide a complete
and extensible workflow solution with a bias towards interoperable 
technologies (BPEL, BPEL4People, XForms, REST, and web services) as a default
implementation.

======================================
 Required software
======================================
A JVM to compile and run the different components. Also, be sure to have 
installed buildr (build tool) and git (version control) installed.

======================================
 Check out tempo
======================================
With the following command:
git clone git://github.com/intalio/tempo.git

======================================
 Installation
======================================
Run the ruby script:
    TEMPO_CHECKOUT/rsc/scripts/tempo_builder.rb
======================================
 Database setup
======================================
Setup a mysql database named "bpms" with user "root" and no password. 
Start mysql engine and check user access. On the command line this would be 
something like:

    mysqladmin create bpms -u root
    mysql -D bpms -u root < TEMPO_CHECKOUT/../intalio/bpms.sql

======================================
 Start up
======================================
In the parent folder of the git clone, you will now find a folder named intalio.
In this folder, a tomcat-tempo-* will be created. This is a tomcat based build, 
so go to the bin folder of apache tomcat, and use the following command:
    catalina.sh run

or on WINDOWS, double click on the icon named:
    startup.bat

Congratulation, tempo is now running!

======================================
 Play with it
======================================
The TaskList or Task inbox is at this URL: http://localhost:8080/ui-fw/
And you can start the sample "AbsenceRequest" process.
