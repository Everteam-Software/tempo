	| one implementing your approach for authenticating usernames and passwords.

			| that fills this role.  If you are using some other kind of credentials than UsernamePasswordCredentials, you will need to replace
			| DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver with a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the credentials you are
			| using.
			|
			| Second, AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers to identify a service requesting a proxy granting ticket. 
			| In the default configuration, it is the HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver that serves this purpose.
