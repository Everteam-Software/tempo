	This is the central configuration file for the database. If the database
    is running in a servlet-context, the configuration file will be read from
    the WEB-INF directory of the web application. Otherwise, the configuration
    is read from the directory specified by the exist.home system property.

    <!-- Configures the database backend:
        - database:
            selects a database backend. Currently, "native" is the
            only valid setting.
        - files:
            path to the directory where database files are
            stored.
        - cacheSize:
            the maximum amount of memory to use for database page buffers.
            Each database file has an associated page buffer for B+-tree and
            data pages. However, the memory specified via cacheSize is shared
            between all page buffers. It represents an absolute maximum, which
            would be occupied if all page buffers were completely full.
        - free_mem_min:
            minimum amount of free memory in percent during indexing. The
            database will start to flush its internal buffers whenever
            free memory drops below the specified limit.
        - pageSize:
            the size of one page on the disk. This is the smallest unit
            transferred from and to the database files. Should be a multiple of
            the operating system's file system page size (usually 4096).

    <!-- The settings below are very conservative to avoid out-of-memory
    exceptions on machines with limited memory (256MB). Increase the
    buffer settings for elements_buffers and words_buffers if you have
    some more memory to waste. -->

            - sync-period
                defines how often the database will flush its
                internal buffers to disk. The sync thread will interrupt
                normal database operation after the specified number of
                milliseconds and write all dirty pages to disk.
            - min: minimum number of connections to keep alive.

    <!-- Default settings for the serializer. Most of these can be changed
    by client code:

    - enable-xinclude:
        should the database expand XInclude tags by default?
    - enable-xsl:
        should the database evaluate XSL processing instructions
        when serializing documents?
    - indent:
        should the serializer pretty-print (indent) XML?
    - match-tagging-elements:
    - match-tagging-attributes:

    - add-exist-id:
        for debugging: add an exist:id attribute to every element, showing
        the internal node identifier (as a long int) assigned to this node.
        Possible values are: "none", "element", "all". "all" displays the node
        of every element node; "element" displays the id only for the root nodes
        of the returned XML fragments.

        Settings for the indexer:
        - suppress-whitespace
            should leading or trailing whitespace be removed from a text
            node? Set to "leading", "trailing", "both" or "none".
        - caseSensitive
            should equality comparisons between strings be case-sensitive or
            insensitive: "yes" or "no".
        - validation
            should XML source files be validated against a schema or DTD before
            storing them? The setting is passed to the XML parser. The actual
            effects depend on the parser you use. eXist comes with Xerces which can
            validate against both: schemas and DTDs. Possible values: "yes",
            "no", "auto". "auto" will leave validation to the parser.
        - stemming
            eXist includes a very simple english language stemmer, based on Porter's algorithm.
            Set the "stemming"-option to "true" if you would like to use stemming. This does
            only work for english.
        - index-depth
            defines the maximum nesting depth of nodes which will be indexed
            in the DOM index. Nodes below the specified nesting depth will
            not be indexed in the DOM file. This has only an effect when
            retrieving query results or for some types of XPath subexpressions, like
            equality comparisons.

	     more include statements below.

	     The include statement expects to find a simple path-
	     expression in it's attribute-tag. Only element or attribute names
		 and the / and // operators are allowed here. Attributes start
		 with a @.

	     Every element matching the path expression will have it's

		 Attributes:
		 	- doctype  the doctype for which this definition should be used.
		 	- default  index everything by default? Set to "none" to switch
		 			   of default indexing.
