            An error has occurred in Orbeon Forms. You may want to try one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a class="xforms-error-panel-close">Close this dialog</a> and continue to use this page.</li>
            <li><a class="xforms-error-panel-reload">Reload this page</a>. Note that you will lose any unsaved changes.</li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If the above does not work, try reloading the page yourself. Note that you will lose any unsaved changes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        With Firefox and Safari: hold down the <code>shift</code> key and click the Reload button in your browser toolbar.
                    </li>
