	| deployerConfigContext.xml centralizes into one file some of the declarative configuration that
	| all CAS deployers will need to modify.
	|
	| This file declares some of the Spring-managed JavaBeans that make up a CAS deployment.  
	| The beans declared in this file are instantiated at context initialization time by the Spring 
	| ContextLoaderListener declared in web.xml.  It finds this file because this
	| file is among those declared in the context parameter "contextConfigLocation".
	|
	| By far the most common change you will need to make in this file is to change the last bean
	| declaration to replace the default SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticationHandler with
	| one implementing your approach for authenticating usernames and passwords.

	<!--
		| This bean declares our AuthenticationManager.  The CentralAuthenticationService service bean
		| declared in applicationContext.xml picks up this AuthenticationManager by reference to its id, 
		| "authenticationManager".  Most deployers will be able to use the default AuthenticationManager
		| implementation and so do not need to change the class of this bean.  We include the whole
		| AuthenticationManager here in the userConfigContext.xml so that you can see the things you will
		| need to change in context.

			| This is the List of CredentialToPrincipalResolvers that identify what Principal is trying to authenticate.
			| The AuthenticationManagerImpl considers them in order, finding a CredentialToPrincipalResolver which 
			| supports the presented credentials.
			|
			| AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers for two purposes.  First, it uses them to identify the Principal
			| attempting to authenticate to CAS /login .  In the default configuration, it is the DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver
			| that fills this role.  If you are using some other kind of credentials than UsernamePasswordCredentials, you will need to replace
			| DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver with a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the credentials you are
			| using.
			|
			| Second, AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers to identify a service requesting a proxy granting ticket. 
			| In the default configuration, it is the HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver that serves this purpose. 
			| You will need to change this list if you are identifying services by something more or other than their callback URL.

					| If you've changed your LoginFormAction to use credentials other than UsernamePasswordCredentials then you will also
					| need to change this bean declaration (or add additional declarations) to declare a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the
					| Credentials you are using.

					| If you are representing services by something more or other than an HTTPS URL whereat they are able to
					| receive a proxy callback, you will need to change this bean declaration (or add additional declarations).

					| local authentication strategy.  You might accomplish this by coding a new such handler and declaring
