/**
 * This interface is to implement by a component manager that wishes to use the deployment service.
 * The lifecycle of a component is defined as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>deployed - a component is deployed with the deploy() call</li>
 * <li>initialized - a component is initialized and ready for serving request</li>
 * <li>started - a component is started; the start() call notifies that all other components are initialized</li>
 * <li>undeployed - a component is undeployed with the undeploy() call; actual resources that the component registered during
 * the deployment are returned by the deployment service for additional clean-up</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * When a component has multiple versions of over the time, there could be at most one active version that serves
 * as the default version of the component. Any requests that do not specify component version that the request wish to use
 * are routed to the default version.
 * <ul>
 * <li>activated - a component version is set to default</li>
 * <li>retired - a component version is set to non-default; the version is still accessible by specifying the version identifier</li>
 * </ul>
